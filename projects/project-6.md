summary: Redesign the RadGrad website to improve the overall User Experience
---

[RadGrad](https://radgrad.ics.hawaii.edu/) is a website created for UH Manoa students to improve the undergraduate STEM degree experience. During the summer of 2020, I had an opportunity to be a part of the RadGrad team. We upgraded the original RadGrad using Typescript, React, and other technologies not present in the original RadGrad. I redesigned the website to improve user experience and conversions. The images below show the updated RadGrad pages. (NOTE: As of August, 2020, RadGrad2 is not yet in production)

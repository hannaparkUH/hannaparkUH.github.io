summary: Redesign the RadGrad website to improve the overall User Experience
---

[RadGrad](https://radgrad.ics.hawaii.edu/) is a website created for UH Manoa students to improve the undergraduate STEM degree experience. During the summer of 2020, I had an opportunity to be a part of the RadGrad team. We upgraded the original RadGrad using Typescript, React, and other technologies not present in the original RadGrad. My role was to redesign the website to improve user experience and conversions. The images below show some of the updated RadGrad pages. (NOTE: As of August 2020, RadGrad2 is not yet in production)

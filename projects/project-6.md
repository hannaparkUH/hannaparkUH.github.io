As a final project, I created a website with my team member using a meteor application template. The main purpose of the website is to provide a rideshare service for the UH community. UH One Ride connects drivers with cars and passengers looking for a ride. Unlike other rideshare websites, UH One Ride is exclusive only for members of the UH system. Throughout this project, I have learned about various web applications tools(Semantic UI, React, Meteor), database, and teamwork.Â

summary: Technical illustrations created in Adobe Illustrator
---

Adobe Illustrator is the first graphic design software I learned. Before switching my career from graphic designer to web designer, I used Illustrator every day at work. I still love Illustrators and use it when I create websites. These are the illustrations I created when I worked as a graphic designer.

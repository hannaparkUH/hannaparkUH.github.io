summary: Technical illustrations created in Adobe Illustrator
---

Adobe Illustrator is the first graphic design software I learned in college. Although Illustrator and Photoshop have a lot in common, there are differences between the two software. Illustrator has advantages that Photoshop doesn't have. Photoshop is based on pixel while Illustrator works off vectors. Vectors are scalable images that can be sized up and down easily. I like drawing and coloring using various tools in Illustrator.

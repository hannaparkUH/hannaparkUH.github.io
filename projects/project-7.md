During the summer of 2020, I had a virtual intership at Collaborative Software Development Laboratory led by Philip Johnson, a Professor in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii. [CSDL](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/)

Our team developed a mobile application called "CSExplore". The app is targeted towards high school students in Hawaii to encourage them to develop interest and awareness in computer science. Throughout our research, we have found that a lack of understanding about Computer Science is one of the reasons many students don't choose to pursue computer science. 93% of parents want their child's school to teach computer sciences, but only 45% of high schools teach it. (according to [code.org] (https://code.org/)) CSExplore could provide useful and fun ways to learn Computer Science skills and connect students to local CS communities. Also, it could help build the Computer Science pipeline from high school to college.

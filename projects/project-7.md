During the summer of 2020, I had a virtual intership at Collaborative Software Development Laboratory led by Philip Johnson, a Professor in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii. [CSDL](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/)

Our team developed a mobile application called "CSExplore". The app is targeted towards high school students in Hawaii to encourage them to develop interest and awareness in computer science. Throughout our research, we had found that a lack of understanding about Computer Science is one of the reasons many students don't choose to pursue computer science. 93% of parents want their child's school to teach computer sciences, but only 45% of high schools teach it. (referenced by [code.org](https://code.org/)) CSExplore could provide useful and fun ways to learn Computer Science skills and connect students to local CS communities. Also, it could help build the Computer Science pipeline from high school to college.

Our team had reviewed several Native App Frameworks and decided to use React Native. React Native has been a popular choice for many companies. Code reusability is one of the benefits using React Native. It is a cross-platform framework that can run both iOS and Android applications. We have developed two different prototypes (Whimsical approach and Professional approach) targeting different types of students. I worked on the Professional approach which provides more professional information such as career goals, computer science degrees, and learning resources selected by professionals. It is more focused on community-oriented resources such as student clubs, hackathons, workshops, and events. Students can get professional advice or feedback from Computer Science experts by posting questions or their Computer Science projects.


## 2020 SURE Symposium

At the end of the internship, our team presented the CSExplore project at the [SURE Symposium](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/urop/summer-undergraduate-research-experience-sure/sure-program/). This internship taught me many things. The best achievement I have gained is that I created my first mobile app. I have many years of experience in creating a website, but it was my first time creating a mobile app. I have found there are many differences between website design and mobile app design. On mobile, users want to get information exactly what they need. It's important to update content frequently and provide interactive features to retain users. It was fun learning a app framework "React Native".

Secondly, I learned how to work with other people remotely by using various online tools such as Discord, Code Together, and Zoom.

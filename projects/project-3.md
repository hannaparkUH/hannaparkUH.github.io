Print design needs more attention and detail than web design because you can't change the design once it's published. Web design is more flexible and dynamic than print design. Web designers can update or fix the design anytime. But web designers need to concern with diffrent screens, different browsers, file sizes and font sizes. It's important to know the differences when you design.

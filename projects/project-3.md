Print design needs more attention and detail than web design because you can’t change the design once it’s published. Web design is more flexible and dynamic than print design because web designers can update or fix the design anytime. However, web designers need to concern with different screens, different browsers, file sizes, and font sizes when they design websites. It’s important to know the differences when you design.

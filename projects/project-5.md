summary: UH One Ride "Commute Smart"
---
I created a website with my team member using a meteor application template. The main purpose of the website is to provide a rideshare service to the UH community. UH One Ride connects drivers with cars and passengers looking for a ride. 
Throughout this project, I have learned about various web applications tools(Sementic UI, React, Meteor), database, and teamwork.

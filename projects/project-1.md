summary: Technical illustrations created in Adobe Illustrator
---
Adobe Illustrator is the first graphic design software I learned when I was 19 years old. At that time, learning graphic design tools made me feel like having superpowers. I was able to express my ideas and get the freedom to create my designs. These days, people tend not to pay attention to details. As a graphic or web designer, it's always important to pay attention to the detail of a design and polish every element of your design. The images below are the technical illustrations I have created in Illustrator.

This game is developed to gain experience in using arrays, object oriented programming, variables, operators, loops, as well as some graphics and sound. The player gets scores as the spider catches bugs and looses scores as the spider gets hit by a net . Once the bug is caught, it desappears and re-appears in some other random location.

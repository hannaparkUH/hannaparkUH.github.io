I studied Package and Graphic Design in college. I think there are many similarities between Package Design and Web design. Package designers create packaging to protect products and also represent its brand. Web designers create websites to display information beautifully and effectively. Usability is an important factor for both package design and web design. When I create websites, I always consider usability as much as design. The good websites should be easy to read, navigate, simple and attractive.

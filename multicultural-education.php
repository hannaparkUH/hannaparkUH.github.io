      <h6 class="title">BACKGROUND</h6>
      <p>According to psychologists from Northwestern University (Anyaso, 2019), children show signs of racial bias from 4-5 years old. Young children clearly recognize race and make categorizations based on race. Developing positive racial attitudes at an early age is very important because racism can affect children’s development and learning. Racism is a complex topic to explain to young children. The most effective way to reduce negative biases is introducing children to a variety of cultural experiences. Multicultural education is a form of education that helps students develop a positive self-concept by providing knowledge about the histories, cultures, and contributions of diverse groups. (The National Association for Multicultural Education)</p>
      <p>Taplin (2015) has found that people develop a fuller awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions by mastering a second language. Bilingualism can positively affect our cognitive processes such as problem-solving and critical thinking. Stewart (2005) has proved that foreign language learning in the early elementary years improves cognitive abilities such as problem-solving and critical thinking. Students who take a foreign language program such as immersion (or Dual language), FLES (Foreign Language in the Elementary Schools), and FLEX (Foreign Language Exploratory) receive higher achievement test scores in reading and math. Multilingualism gives a greater insight into their mother tongue language by acquiring the mechanics of a second language: grammar, conjugations, and sentence structure.</p>
      <p>Multicultural & Multilingual Education (MME) is designed for elementary students (grades K-5) in Hawaii. The main goal of MME is to help students learn cultural consciousness and develop a sense of responsibility towards other communities. This course will use a blended learning model that incorporates traditional face-to-face learning and online learning. Blended learning model offers flexibility for teachers and students. By using technology in instruction, teachers can act as facilitators who provide resources, monitor students, give feedback, and check progress. Blended learning allows students to engage their individual learning experiences at their own pace. It can be an effective teaching method for students from diverse backgrounds. According to Banks (1995), teachers must pay attention to the following five dimensions to implement multicultural education effectively. 1. Content Integration, 2. Knowledge Construction Process, 3. Prejudice Reduction, 4. Equity Pedagogy, 5. An empowering school culture and social structure. I have applied the Bank’s five dimensions of multicultural education to the MME course design.</p>

      <h6 class="title">CONTENT</h6>
      <p>Content should reflect a full wide range of diversity to meet the needs of multicultural education. It is crucial for teachers to know about their students’ backgrounds and culture and choose content based on their diversity. Students should see their cultural groups represented in the lessons. As a designer, I will design a Multicultural & Multilingual Education (MME) website that provides resources for elementary students to explore various cultures. The MME website contains six main pages: food, arts, people, holidays, languages, religions, and countries. Each page lists related information from a variety of cultures. The subpages contain related lessons and assignments such as readings, photos, and videos. This website is built with a CMS platform (Content Management System Platform) to help teachers create and modify content easily.</p>
      <p>Teachers use examples and content from a variety of cultures to explain key concepts, generalizations, and issues in their teaching. (Banks, 1995) Every week, teachers choose a new topic from the MME website and provide students with one or two related activities to explore the culture. These activities will motivate students to investigate, ask questions, and develop curiosity about the culture.</p>

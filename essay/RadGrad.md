As a transfer student and a student parent, I sometimes find myself at school that is not the right fit, either socially or academically. I am always busy taking courses, working part-time and raising kids.  It is not easy for me to meet classmates and get latest school information. RadGrad helps me to explore opportunities and connect to other students. RadGrad is very useful resource for most students, especially for minority students like me. 

## Importance of Visual Content
Visuals are an important part of websites especially for college students. It can attract and retain users. RadGrad do not use much graphic elements such as photos, icons and graphs.  The People follow directions with texts and images, understand content better than those who follow the directions with only texts.  RadGrad also need more attractive “calls to action” to make users to navigate the website more easily.

## Suggestions for Improvement
1. Homepage – There are too many scroll bars are used. It looks a little cluttered and most of them probably are not needed. Instead of using scroll bars, we can shorten the description and add “view more” which links to the related page.
2. About Me / ICE Points / Level – I think we could combine these three sections and add more personal information on the “About Me” page. (i.e. resume, projects, clubs and etc.)
3. Explorer – When I click “EXPLORER” on the main menu bar, it appears blank. We could use some attractive images and “call to action” buttons which guides users to subpages. The subpages look all very similar. We could differentiate each section using different colors, icons, layouts, or images. I think the “opportunities” is the issue college students are most interested. The menu “opportunities” should be moved to the main menu. 
4. External links - When users click external links, it opens the page in the same frame. It makes users hard to go back to RadGard website. 

## Ways to increase traffic to RadGrad
Unfortunately, I do not visit Regard regularly. I visit RadGrad at the beginning of the semester to get help for course selection and at the end of the semester to update ICE points.  I would visit RadGrad more often if I can get new updates regularly. Email blast is a very effective way to inform new updates (events, career opportunities, course of the month and etc.) to the users. 

School clubs (ACMManoa, Grey Hats, and etc.) should also be a part of RadGrad. There are so many benefits joining college clubs. It helps students to build connections, learn new skills, find more opportunities, and provide memorable college experience. If RadGrad offers platforms for clubs to advertise, more students will visit RadGrad regularly.

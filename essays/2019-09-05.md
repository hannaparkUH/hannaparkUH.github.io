I am a mother of two kids, a student and a graphic designer. I am living the busiest time on my life. 

Before I gave birth to my first child, I worked as a web/graphic designer for 8 years in IT department. I designed websites and developed HTML/CSS. I worked with web developers and became fascinated by programing. I wished to learn programing languages and pair programming with my creativity.

After my first child was born, I decided to stay home with my kids until they go to kindergarten. For the last few years, I was busy taking my kids to zoo, beaches, playgrounds and playdates. I really enjoyed spending time with my kids, but sometimes missed my workplace. When my first child became 4, started taking CS courses at University of Hawaii. A CS degree is much harder than I imaged. I regret not starting to learn CS sooner. Although I am a slow learner compared to other young students, I know what I exactly want to do after graduation. I want to develop education websites, software and apps for students.

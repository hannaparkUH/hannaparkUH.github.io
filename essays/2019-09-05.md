I am a mother of two kids, a student and a part-time graphic designer. I am living the busiest time on my life. 

Before I gave birth to my first child, I worked as a web/graphic designer for 8 years in IT department. I designed websites and developed HTML/CSS. I worked with web developers and became fascinated by programing. I wished to learn programing languages and pair programming with my creativity.

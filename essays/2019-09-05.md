I am a mother of two kids, a student, and a graphic designer. I am living the busiest time in my life.

Before I gave birth to my first child, I worked as a web/graphic designer for eight years in the IT department. I designed websites and developed HTML/CSS. I worked with web developers and became fascinated by programming. I wished to learn programming languages and pair programming with my creativity.

After my first child was born, I decided to stay home with my kids until they go to kindergarten. For the last few years, I was busy taking my kids to the zoo, beaches, playgrounds, and playdates. I enjoyed spending time with my kids, but sometimes missed my workplace. When my first child became 4, I started taking Computer Science courses at the University of Hawaii. A Computer Science degree was much harder than I imagined.. I sometimes regret not starting to learn Computer Science sooner. Though I am a slow learner compared to other young students, I know what I exactly want to do after graduation. I want to develop education websites, apps, and software for students.

I am currently working part-time at Information Technology Service (ITS) at UH. When I started the job, I was entirely amazed by new programming software and tools. For the last six years, many things has been changed. I realize that IT professionals need to constantly update their skills to survive.

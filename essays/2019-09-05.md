I am a mother of two kids, a student and a graphic designer. I am living the busiest time on my life. 

Before I gave birth to my first child, I worked as a web/graphic designer for 8 years in IT department. I designed websites and developed HTML/CSS. I worked with web developers and became fascinated by programing. I wished to learn programing languages and pair programming with my creativity.

After my first child was born, I decided to stay home with my kids until they go to kindergarten. For the last few years, I was busy taking my kids to zoo, beaches, playgrounds and playdates. I really enjoyed spending time with my kids, but sometimes missed my workplace. When my first child became 4, I started taking Computer Science courses at University of Hawaii. A Computer Science degree was much harder than I imaged. I regret not starting to learn Computer Science sooner. Although I am a slow learner compared to other young students, I know what I exactly want to do after graduation. I want to develop education websites, software and apps for students.

I am currently working part-time at Information Technology Service (ITS) at UH. When I started the job, I was completely amazed by new programming software and tools.  Front-end developers use BootStrap instead of writing code. Companies use GitHub to manage projects. For the last 6 years, many things has been changed. I am realizing that IT professionals need to constantly update their skills to survive.

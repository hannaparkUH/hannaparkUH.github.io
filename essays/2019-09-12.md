##Too much Information?
Today, we can get information we need quickly with flexibility. The development of Information Technology makes our lives easier, faster and better. People can not only access but also create vast amount of information easily. New information is created every second. Sometimes, we feel tired because of "Information Overload" or "Unnecessary Information"

##Online Communities for Learning
The development of Information Technology has changed the ways of learning. In the past, we had to go to library or meet people to get information. It took much time and efforts. Online communities provide free access to anyone who wants to learn. Stack Overflow is one of the popular online communities for students and professionals to learn/share their programming knowledge.

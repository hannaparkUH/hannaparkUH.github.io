## Is there such thing as a stupid question?

When I worked as a web designer several years ago, I had used JavaScript for creating galley pages or animations. I didn't know about JavaScript. So, I simply downloaded the open source code from online and just modified sizes/images. Unlike C++ and Java, JavaScript is a scripting language. Anyone can easily modify and update JavaScript codes because it can be opened in most programs (even in text editors). JavaScript makes websites more interesting and interactive. I have always wanted to learn JavaScript and apply my ideas to websites using JavaScript. I am so glad that I can finally learn JavaScript in ICS 314. 

## Whatâ€™s a smart question?

Stack Overflow, a question and answer site for programmers, is a great resource for anyone who may have issues with code or who may simply want to learn new or different methods of doing something. There I found examples of good questions and bad questions, which could probably be improved.

In the following example, we examine the components of a decent question. In this case, the asker is trying to figure out a way to get the date of the previous month in Python.


A: datetime and the datetime.timedelta classes are your friend.

1. find today
2. use that to find the first day of this month.
3. use timedelta to backup a single day, to the last day of the previous month.
4. print the YYYYMM string you're looking for.

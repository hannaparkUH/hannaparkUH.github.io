I am a mother of two kids, a student, and a graphic designer. Before I gave birth to my first child, I worked as a web/graphic designer for eight years in the IT department. I designed websites and did front-end development. I worked with web developers and became fascinated by programming. I wished to learn programming languages and pair programming with my creativity.

After my first child was born, I decided to stay home with my kids until they go to kindergarten. For the last few years, I was busy taking my two daughters to the zoo, beaches, playgrounds, and playdates. I did enjoy spending time with my kids but sometimes missed my workplace. When my first child became 4, I started taking Computer Science courses part-time at the University of Hawaii. A Computer Science degree was much harder than I imagined. I sometimes regret not starting to learn Computer Science sooner. Though I am a slow learner compared to other young students, I know what I exactly want to do after graduation. I want to develop education websites, apps, and software for students. Hopefully, the CS degree helps my dream come true. 

“Wisdom means to choose now what will make sense later. I am learning everyday to allow the space between where I am and where I want to be, to inspire me and not terrify me.” - Tracee Ellis Ross

## My first CSS/UI framework "Bootstrap"
When I worked as a web designer 7 years ago, my company didn't use CSS/UI frameworks. Web designers had to write same CSS codes repeatedly and test a website in difference browsers/platforms. I've started working at ITS from this summer. My boss asked me to learn Bootstrap for the website projects. After I learned Bootstrap, I was amazed by how easy bootstrap can make things and save hours of work.

I think the best tool of BootStrap is a built-in responsive grid system. The bootstrap grid divides the screen into 12 columns. You can adjust the layout easily according to the size of the device. Bootstrap also provides standard components such as nav bars, drop downs, buttons, forms etc. You can quickly style the elements by downloading the source code. Bootstrap is compatible with main browsers. You don't need to worry about cross-browser problems.

## CSS/UI frameworks limit the creativity of web designers
The websites above were created in the early 2010s. I think they look more creative and attractive compared to today's websites created with CSS/UI frameworks. These days, most websites look more alike than they should be. Top menu bars, full-sized background images, titles in the middle of the screen, same grids. Innovative designs are difficult to implement into CSS/UI frameworks because of the fixed 12 columns. Some of web designers don't use Photoshop or Illustrator anymore when they create a website. They show customers design mockups in HTML/CSS using CSS/UI frameworks. It seems web designers have given up on creativity and been relied on CSS/UI templates.

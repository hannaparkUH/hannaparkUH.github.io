## My first CSS/UI framework "Bootstrap"
When I worked as a web designer 7 years ago, my company didn't use CSS/UI frameworks. Web designers had to write same CSS codes repeatedly and test a website in difference browsers/platforms. I've started working at ITS from this summer. My boss asked me to learn Bootstrap for the website projects. After I learned Bootstrap, I was amazed by how easy bootstrap can make things and save hours of work.

I think the best tool of BootStrap is a built-in responsive grid system. The bootstrap grid divides the screen into 12 columns. You can adjust the layout easily according to the size of the device. Bootstrap also provides standard components such as nav bars, drop downs, buttons, forms etc. You can quickly style the elements by downloading the source code. Bootstrap is compatible with main browsers. You don't need to worry about cross-browser problems.
